## Mathematics

This folder involves mathematics that I have learned. Mathematics is the basis of Computational Models and Learning Algorithms. We learned from Matrix Manipulations and Visualization to Convex Optimization, and from Pattern Recognition to Deep Learning.

## Numerical Methods
This is to solve the problems in a numerical fashion.

## Learning Algorithms
This is to learn the data insights using learning algorithms.

## Convex Optimization
This is to solve convex optimization problems. Most of learning problems can be transformed into optimization problems.
